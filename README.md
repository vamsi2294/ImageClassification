# ImageClassification
Image Classifier 
Introduction:
The project is about classification of images. The python file requires some libraries to be
installed.
Requirements:
This project requires the following modules/libraries:
● Python 3
● Jupyter notebook
● OpenCV (for image processing)
● Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
● Keras (for convolutional neural network and image augmentation)
● Pandas (for data handling)
● Numpy (to flatten images and handle arrays)
● Matplotlib (to plot the images and to analyze through graphs)
Recommended Modules:
● Weka (for feature selection)
Installation:
This project requires the installation of all above mentioned modules. The process to install them
